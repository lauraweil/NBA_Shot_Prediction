# NBA_Shot_Prediction
This repository is dedicated to hosting two distinct machine learning models developed as part of a master's thesis on predicting shot success in NBA basketball games. It contains two Jupyter Notebooks: one employing a Random Forest algorithm (RandomForest.ipynb), and the other using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) (NeuralNetwork.ipynb).

Certainly! Here's a description for your GitHub repository that contains both the Random Forest and FNN Neural Network notebooks for your NBA shot prediction master thesis:

# Models

- **Random Forest Model (`RandomForest.ipynb`):** This notebook presents a detailed approach using the Random Forest algorithm. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.

- **Feedforward Neural Network Model (`NeuralNetwork.ipynb`):** This notebook outlines the application of a Feedforward Neural Network for shot prediction. It covers the entire workflow from data handling to neural network architecture, training, and performance evaluation.

# Key Features

- **In-Depth Data Analysis:** Both notebooks feature comprehensive data analysis, offering insights into the patterns and trends in NBA shot data.
- **Model Comparison:** Opportunity to compare the effectiveness of Random Forest and Neural Network models in the context of sports analytics.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Each model aims to provide accurate predictions of shot outcomes, demonstrating the power of machine learning in sports.

# Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the notebooks are provided within each file. Users are encouraged to explore and experiment with the models to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning applications in sports analytics.
