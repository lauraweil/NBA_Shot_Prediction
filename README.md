# NBA_Shot_Prediction
This repository is dedicated to hosting two distinct machine learning models developed as part of a master's thesis on predicting shot success in NBA basketball games. It contains two Jupyter Notebooks: one employing a Random Forest algorithm (RandomForest.ipynb), and the other using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) (NeuralNetwork.ipynb).
